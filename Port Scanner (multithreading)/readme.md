This is a simple Python 3 based port scanning utility, allowing you to choose to scan every port, commonly exposed ports, or a target port. Only works with IPv4 address, no IPv6 support.
These versions support multi-threading to increase the rate of all port scanning.
Fancy versions require pyfiglet and colorama to function.
