This program attempts to automatically detect devices on your local network, by attempting to connect to any ip within subnet 255.255.255.0 of your local ip address. From there,
the user may attempt to scan the ports of all detected IP addresses, which will be collected into a dictionary containing alive hosts and any open ports found.
Currently it uses a simple socket connection, so it is not very stealthy, but from pre-testing, it does seem to work reasonably well.
