This is a simple Python 3 based port scanning utility, allowing you to choose to scan every port, commonly exposed ports, or a target port. Only works with IPv4 address, no IPv6 support.
As far as I know, the domain scanning should work, but no guarantees, since it's not meant for scanning for existing website pages or other, just ports.
I could only get it to work consistently within an IDE or using CMD, for some reason when running as an executable it crashes out when inputting an address.
